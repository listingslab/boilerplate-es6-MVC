## Boilerplate for JavaScript ES6 MVC Application using Sass

Quickly get up and running with an JavaScript [ES6](https://es6.io) MVC Application and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) styling. Uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io) to transpile the source code into browser-ready JavaScript and CSS but you can easily adapt it to your own workflow.

#### What is MVC?
Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers. It divides a given application into three interconnected parts in order to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to and accepted from the user.



#### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/listingslab/boilerplate-es6-sass.git project-name
cd project-name
sudo npm install
