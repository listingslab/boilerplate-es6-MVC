## ES6 Boilerplate MVC Application

Quickly get up and running with an ES6 MVC Application. To get up and running wuickly, the project uses gulp and babel to transpile the source code into browser-ready JavaScript but you can easily adapt it to your own workflow.

#### What is MVC?
Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces on computers. It divides a given application into three interconnected parts in order to separate internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to and accepted from the user.


#### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/listingslab/boilerplate-es6-mvc.git
cd boilerplate-es6-mvc
sudo npm install
```
